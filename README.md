A project from the module Object Oriented Programming with Java, part of my MSc course 2023-2024, 

A natural language interpreter for a Zork-like text adventure game. The game is designed to load any adventure game that aligns with certain rules. Entities and actions are defined in configuration files. The game responds to built-in commands and custom commands (defined in a config file).

Built-in commands:

- inventory (inv)
- get
- goto
- drop
- look
